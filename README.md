## About

My aim for this project is to practice my frontend development skills in React - getting the hang of hooks, components, and code structure. Alongside this, I will use TailwindCSS for the styling of my web application. My reasoning for using NextJS and Tailwind in my project is because these technologies are commonly used by industry professionals and would therefore like to hone my skills towards this standard.

This is a web application that displays quotes using the QuoteGarden API (https://github.com/pprathameshmore/QuoteGarden). Users have the option to display a random quote which also states its author. The name of the author can be clicked to display more of their quotes in a list view.

## Ideas to Implement in the Future

After the frontend has been completed, to take the project further I have a few ideas:

- Make a backend for the application - make it full-stack
  - Ability to create user accounts and implement user authentication (Optional: Google and Apple Auth)
    - User dashboard
  - "Favourite" system for quotes and authors (represented by a star/heart button)
    - Uses a database to store the id of the quote/author (which is already included with the QuoteGarden api) so that in dashboard view, users can quickly reach their favourite quotes or view their favourite authors.
  - C#/.NET (?)
