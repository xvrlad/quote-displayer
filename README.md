## About
My aim for this project is to practice my frontend development skills in React and TailwindCSS.

This is a web application that displays quotes using the QuoteGarden API (https://github.com/pprathameshmore/QuoteGarden). Users have the option to display a random quote which also states its author. The name of the author can be clicked to display more of their quotes in a list view.
